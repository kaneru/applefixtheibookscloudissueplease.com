        <h1>Apple, fix the iBooks cloud issue, please!</h1>
        <p>I'm done! This is nonsense!</p>
        <p>iBooks has this annoying "feature" that is that your books are constantly moved to iCloud for no good reason. <b>Even if there is plenty of free space on disk</b>.</p>
        <p>What if I'm on a plane, Apple? I would like to read my books that I had downloaded the day or two before, but they are gone from my device!</p>
        <p>I don't want to turn off iBooks from using iCloud. I really like the feature that all my bookmarks and notes from books are synced across my devices in iBooks. It is really convienient. What is not convienient is that I can't read my books like that. Why do I have to download them from the cloud again and again?</p>
        <p>It should not be like that. I refuse to believe that this is the way iBooks and my books work together.</p>
        <p><b>Apple, prevent iBooks from moving books to the cloud, please!</b></p>
